## V. Tools and Actions (How?)
Discussions should be posted to multiple forums/mediums to increase engagement and the proposal author(s) should actively watch each platform to cross-pollinate ideas.

Proposal results should be published to various platforms
When a proposal is submitted, it must always follow the voting process and templates as defined in this post: Community governance Process

### A. Commonwealth
* Public location, easy to reference with link
* User wallets are integrated
* Cleaner, calmer experience overall

### B. Discord Posting
* Gov discord channel and twitter are good for driving traffic and participation
* Using bots in Discord to notify the community that proposal discussion is posted on Commonwealth and Discord, and once on-chain

### C. Twitter Spaces 
* Holding spaces once significant discussion in forums has taken place and perhaps again once final proposal is live (on-chain) for voting
* All stakeholders encouraged to participate and retweet Spaces and tweets concerning proposal
